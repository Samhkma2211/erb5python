            <h4>Love your life and love your pets!</h4>
            <p>In 2009, Clara Chan, a lifelong animal lover, found herself standing in the rain outside a shivering, abandoned golden retriever puppy. She took him home, named him Sunny, and nursed him back to health. But as she visited local shelters to find Sunny's siblings, she was heartbroken by the overcrowded facilities and the lack of resources for pet owners struggling to care for their animals. Clara, then a 28-year-old veterinary assistant, gathered her friendsâ€”a dog trainer, a retired teacher and a marketing freelancer. They establish a one-stop organization to rescue animals, support pet owners and build a community.</p>
